# midnight-artic-1200
These are the primer sets and bed files associated with the Midnight ARTIC 1200 bp primer scheme for SARS-CoV-2 sequencing. v1 is the first version as published in [Freed et al. 2020](https://academic.oup.com/biomethods/article/5/1/bpaa014/5873518 "Rapid and inexpensive whole-genome sequencing"). This work arose from the foundational work done by the [ARTIC Netwwork](https://artic.network/ncov-2019 "SARS-CoV-2 ARTIC").

v1.1 is the first improvement to the Midnight scheme, due to a theoretical proposal by [Nikki Freed and myself](https://twitter.com/freed_nikki/status/1464477513107730433 "Omicron fix"), with confirmation by [Oxford Nanopore](https://nanoporetech.com/covid-19 "January 2022 update"). This fixes the amplicon 28 dropout seen in Omicron, and as of January 2022 is the design used by Oxford Nanopore.

v1.2 is the second improvement, due to work by [John Tyson](https://twitter.com/DrT1973/status/1483923837137784832 "John Tyson whack-a-mole"). This includes three additional primers as compared to v1.1, which fixes coverage decreases seen in Omicron. As of February 2022 this will be the pool [released by IDT](https://sg.idtdna.com/pages/products/next-generation-sequencing/workflow/xgen-ngs-amplicon-sequencing/predesigned-amplicon-panels/sars-cov-2-midnight-amp-panel "IDT amplicon panel").
